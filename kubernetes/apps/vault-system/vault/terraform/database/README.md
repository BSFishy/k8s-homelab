# Vault Database Configuration

This directory will contain Terraform configuration for Vault database secret engines.

This is separated from base configuration because it depends on databases being up and running.

## Examples

- PostgreSQL secret engine configuration
- Redis secret engine configuration
- Database roles and policies
